# My Data Analyst Sample Projects

Hey welcome 👋

This repo collects the projects, experiments and tools I’ve been learning with — everything from messy raw data to dashboards and automation. If you’re curious about how I learn, what I build, or want to collaborate, you’re in the right place.

What’s in this repo
1. Marketing Analytics — End-to-End Project

A full end-to-end project built around a marketing problem.
Think: define the business question → clean the data → run sentiment analysis → build a Power BI dashboard → prepare a stakeholder-ready presentation.
(There’s the raw file , a short write-up and the Power BI files in the folder.)

2. SQL Project

Exploratory Data Analysis for a multi-location retail supermarket using SQL (and some AI-assistance ). Great for practicing joins, window functions and aggregation patterns.

3. Power BI Project

An interactive dashboard focused on retail plant-store metrics — sales trends, store comparisons, and a few slicers that make exploration easy.

4. Excel Project

A Coffee Sales dashboard built in Excel — demonstrates pivot tables, charts, data cleaning and summarize the raw data.

5. n8n Automation Projects

Reusable workflow templates:

Gmail AI Agent — small automation to help with email triage/replies

RAG-based Chatbot — retrieval-augmented workflow for answering questions from docs

6. Course Certificates

Certs of the courses I completed that helped build these projects — listed so you can see the learnings that I used.

# Tech I use

SQL · Python  · Power BI · Excel · n8n · basic AI tools for prototyping

# Why I built this

I’m learning by doing — and sharing that process. Each project started because I wanted to solve a small, real problem and learn a specific skill (dashboarding, SQL patterns, automation, etc.). The repo is both a playground and a portfolio.

# How to explore

Start with the README file .

Power BI files and Excel workbooks are in their folders.



If you find something useful, or want to point out a better approach, I’d love to hear from you.
